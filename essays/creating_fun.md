# Going Against What I Believe In

I originally had a cute little site in html and vanilla js.
It was functional, fast, hand-crafted, free to host and completely fine.
It looked just about as boring as this site (I'm not much of a designer) and was about 4 files.

The only reason JavaScript made an appearance was because I had a cool project idea for a kanban board my way.
So this project corrupted my really fast HTML/CSS site with gross JS.
Oh no, my initial payload was going to be so big. The download|parse|execution times!
I'd have to make sure to minify and compress and coerce or else my 1 monthly visitor would face the full force of bloat caused by my once fun project.

Now clearly, this story is a bit exaggerated. These concerns are completely unwarranted.
My performance was still well in the green and my site continued to sit.

I strongly believe in keeping things as simple as they need to be. 
I try and fight the urge of premature optimization every day.
And yes, there comes a time when optimizations are no longer premature, but for any and every case I find my personal site in, almost any worry is premature.

My old site was simple. It worked and displayed information and had a few links and what not.
But that didn't mean it was perfect.
I wanted to have a site where I could put stuff, and not just text or markup, but a site where I could put anything.
I wanted a site where I could have fun. Where I could experiment with new technologies and techniques.
My old site did not really allow this. 

I could do many things, but many things I couldn't.

I guess it's not that I couldn't, but it was that in between me working, studying, doing homework, creating a thesis, being married, looking at jobs, staying sharp, etc, etc, etc I couldn't find time to figure out how to do that one thing.
That one thing I thought would be fun but turned out to be a headache.
It wasn't even just one thing, it was one thing today, another two things tomorrow, a few things from yesterday.

My site, the site I wanted to just have fun and do whatever I wanted, began to not be fun.
It began being the place I couldn't just put stuff.
Projects I wanted to host so people could actually see them in action.
Projects I wanted to let my friends pull up on their phones.
Projects I wanted my parents to be able to play with.
Projects I wanted, couldn't _just_ be carried over, couldn't _just_ be plugged in.

So yeah, I decided to jump into nextjs.
I decided to try and make this fun again.

I recently read [this](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639521/svelte-creator-web-development-should-be-more-fun.html) interview with the svelte creator, and in it they touch on how web development should be fun.
Not only this, but they describe framework development as `playful'. 
In a world of React vs Angular vs Vue vs insert framework here, I never would have thought something thinks this should be fun.
But then it reminded me, this should be fun.

My personal site should be fun, it should be exciting.
It should be a place to explore.
A place to learn and grow and make mistakes and break best practices.

So while I usually always strive for the simple solution, I decided for this site, I could be extra. I could use the framework I don't need in order to mess around and do stuff that don't make sense for the use case.

But I think that's kind of the key thing in all this.

The use case is whatever I want.
