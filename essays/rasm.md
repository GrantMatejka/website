# Rasm

For my Master's thesis I was really interested in WebAssembly.

I think the project, ecosystem and community are very strong, but still very young. I suspect the full impact of the work has not been realized or materialized yet.

When looking into WebAssembly, I realized there was a surprising lack of functional programming languages that were being ported over.

I decided to look into what it would take to compile Racket to WebAssembly.

## Resources

My full experience is outlined in my [thesis](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4067&context=theses) and the compiler itself is available on my [github](https://github.com/GrantMatejka/rasm).
