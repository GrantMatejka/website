# Finalizing the Report

I first became aware of WebAssembly at my last job at the company The Parable Group. I was working in the .NET ecosystem and specifically with the Blazor framework, and while I was not using the wasm flavor of Blazor, it was the focal point of all the conferences. It was a fancy new technology, bundled up in a cool little framework, backed by Microsoft and promising big things, but I never really knew what it was. I knew what Blazor as a framework was, what it did and what it wanted to accomplish, but I didn't know how WebAssembly fit into it. I didn't know what WebAssembly _really_ was.

## The Summer of Wasm

This summer I began to delve deeper into the world of WebAssembly.

What it really is. Who uses it. Where they use it. How they use it. Why don't people use it. What to expect from it. What does it need.

I did this to learn, grow and build a strong foundation of knowledge before I began work on my thesis on the topic.

I did this to develop a widespread and more realistic view of the landscape of the technology.

I wanted to be more confident in my ability to navigate and explore the world of wasm.

As I am putting the finishing touches on my initial report I am simultaneously reflecting and trying to see what this community needs. I am trying to take in all the knowledge I have acquired and turn it into action. Action of making a difference and contributing something meaningful, something to help people and fellow developers.
