# About Me

My education, professional experience and personal interest has lead me to experiment with and develop skills in anything from Algorithms to Data structures to Full Stack Web Development to Game Design/Development and so much more. Utilizing knowledge of numerous Programming Languages (Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, C, ...) and Frameworks (React Native, ASP.NET Core 3.0, Blazor, ...) I have had a thrill exploring and growing in the field of Software Development. My coding experience that isn't able to be described fully here is available on my GitHub, including numerous projects and experiments. For insight into my work experience please refer to my LinkedIn or download my resume.

## Experience

### Software Engineering Apprentice, iFixit _November 2020 - Present_

Working alongside a team of seasoned developers in legacy codebase, written in structured PHP and JavaScript/React. Contributing directly to the current site in improving functionality, fixing bugs and implementing new features. Team is heavily coordinated with many remote workers and currently fully remote for all team members, with an emphasis in pull request code reviews and documenting through git history. Hands on and head first approach to learning the structure and function of the codebase while being heavily active in transitioning legacy systems to newer
alternatives.

### Software Developer Intern, The Parable Group _January 2020 - December 2020_

Utilizing Blazor, "a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET" (docs.microsoft.com), I am responsible for writing efficient, high quality code for The Parable Group's web product, Parable Connect. My responsibilities also include researching new technologies, furthering development on individual side projects and performing any other various tasks that may be requested of me. Side projects also necessitate utilizing mapping api's, developing location based services and full stack web development. Majority of work is done utilizing Microsoft suite of tools and ASP.NET Core 3, especially Blazor, and requires understanding of big data
structure, value and utility.

## Interests

When I'm not coding I enjoy reading books of all genres. Some topics I specifically enjoy to read about are religious studies, ancient Greece, programming and classics. If reading takes too much energy I usually move over to playing videogames.

After a long day of work I enjoy going outside for a nice walk or taking care of my small garden. Living in San Luis Obispo the weather is almost always nice and beautiful hikes are only a short drive away.

Why such a boring site?

Simply because I didn't think my site needed a bunch of weight (some would say bloat). I decided to go with nextjs for reasons I may explain later on. I'm just writing and stuff so text does fine on its own with some fancy stuff thrown in for flair.
