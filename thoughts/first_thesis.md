### Thesis Log #1

This is the first entry of hopefully many recounting my experience in the research, development and defense of my Master's Thesis. I am at the point of research and feel now is the perfect time to begin a journal of my experience, so that I can look back on this time in my life and so that maybe someone out on the internet can learn from my experience, as I do the same.

For context, I have just recently (~15 weeks ago) started my post baccalaureate academic career. The 'usual' timeline in my program is that students work on a thesis for three academic quarters and I am getting a good head start by starting my research in the summer quarter. This means I will still have Fall, Winter and Spring to continue working as well, if need be.

I spent much of my last academic quarter working to find an advisor I'd be honored to work with and a project topic that would benefit from said advisor's experience, as well as edify the both of us. The project topic I landed on is WebAssembly.

I decided on WebAssembly for many reasons, but some of these are:
- My experience in web dev
- *[hot take]* The future/present of development is the web
- WebAssembly (wasm) is a very promising technology
- My advisor has experience and connections with the technology and community
- I believe in the vision of wasm
- It provides many opportunities for projects

On the last point, one thing I am most excited about, as I am still in the research phase, are the possibilities for projects I can pursue under the wasm umbrella. I think as a masters student this technology gives me the opportunity to spend time in the fantasyland of concepts and  theories while also getting plenty of opportunities to get a workout in the rough and tough reality of software development. These two worlds fascinate me a lot. I love balancing theory and practice. Maybe someday I will write some of my thoughts on 'good ideas' and how they can easily transform into unmaintained hacks in the codebase. 

Now what is my thesis right now? This is probably going to change but here is my idea...

I see WebAssembly as a very promising technology. I see it as a community of people who believe in this promise and wish to see it through. The goals of wasm stand strong, with key points they are interested in (I will talk about these at a later time). Somehow, with all these factors going for it, wasm has struggled to gain popularity. Developers still don't know what it is and very few actually use it. I want to know why this is. I want to know if I can do anything to change this. I want to explore the community, I want to see what it needs (if anything), and if it needs something, I want to see if I can provide that.

I have read endless articles, but my first course of real research is reading the spec. I feel like I need to understand what wasm _actually_ is. After that, who knows. If anyone reading this knows of any cool wasm projects or pages or hot takes or unpopular opinions, please feel free to email me or dm me on linkedin.

Thanks.

These are my first ramblings, and hopefully I continue rambling as I continue my journey into exploring wasm.
