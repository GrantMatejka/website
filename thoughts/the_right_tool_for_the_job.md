### The Right Tool for the Job

_Originally posted some thoughts about this on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantmatejka/)_

As I've grown as a software engineer, I can't help but feel like there's this nagging pressure by the industry at large to utilize the new hottest technology, when frankly, it may not be necessary.

I may be totally wrong on this, but I don't think software is an industry of trends. Clearly, trends affect the lives of developers heavily, but I can't think of many instances of trends that have truly changed the way we write software. UML used to be considered a lot more 'useful' than today. I'm sure kanban is going to overrated someday (tomorrow??). Certainly the Unix philosophy birthed microservice architectures, but even a movement this influential and old hasn't demanded adoption from all of us.

This is not to say that these trends or technologies are evil. This isn't to say that these trends are even bad. Actually, a lot of these trends are quite cool and useful and innovative, but each trend is only useful in its respective  domain. Not everything is destined to be fulfilled by the latest buzzwords marketing found on google.

I recently read Martin Fowler's piece called Monolith First which provides some pretty convincing reasons to take the more 'boring' architectural approach first rather the blindly jumping into buzzword promoted microservice architecture.

I was also just listening to the Angel podcast episode with Mark Cuban and host Jason Calacanis. Mr. Cuban said that companies need to stop acting like they have to include some AI in their product and should just stick to their google sheets or excel with some basic machine learning algorithms. Hearing someone say not to use AI was such a relief, as I feel like too often developers are convinced to invest in trends rather than results.

I feel a need to promote the use of the right tool for the job. We can't be getting caught up with recent trends or buzzwords, but rather we need to get caught up with doing our jobs well. Not every app needs AI, not every project should be split into microservices, but rather every product is unique and its my job as a developer to find the tools needed (and that's what makes being a developer so fun).

As stated above, these things aren't bad. There are use cases for most (if not all) the different technologies we  have today, but not every project demands every technology. That would be absurd. As developers, engineers and professionals we need to discern what is needed where. Why is something needed? What are the drawbacks? How does this scale?  What does maintainability look like?

Asking and answering these questions is what differentiates a programmer from a software engineer. I love programming. I program on the weekends. However, when I'm on the clock I'm an engineer, and that's a lot of fun too.
