# The Piece

I did a small report on some team's approaches to developing AI agents for drones, and I figured, "Hey why not put this out in the real world". So, I uploaded the paper to medium.

Here's the abstract and the full piece can be found [HERE](https://medium.com/@grantmatejka1/simulation-and-application-of-ai-powered-autonomous-flight-in-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-bfdcdb650bd3).

## Abstract

Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) technology, and more specifically drones, have led to novel use cases and a need for autonomous flight of said drones. Some of these use cases include surveying specified geographic areas, identifying wildlife of interest, package delivery and even the sport of drone racing. However, artificial intelligence algorithms are difficult to utilize due to the physical nature of drones, which makes testing potentially expensive and difficult to iterate on. Not only this, but the drone itself serves as a space with very limited resources available for computation and algorithmic analysis of its environment.

I am interested in exploring the field of UAV simulation, how these simulations serve as a foundation for AI algorithm testing and development and what applications of AI algorithms trained in simulated environments we currently see in the drone space. This research will serve as a brief survey of some approaches in the field simulation environments for drones, the current utilization of AI algorithms on drones and how these two fields come together to empower autonomous flight on modern drones.
